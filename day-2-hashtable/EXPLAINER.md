# Task

Make a hash table in TypeScript and Python _and_ explain when you would use it.

## What is a hash table

A hash table is basically like an object in JavaScript or a dictionary in Python because hash tables are happening under the hood. It's basically an array of key/value pairs. The big thing is the time complexity optimization. Instead of having to go through each element in an array to find out if a value exists (O(n)), you can check for a specific value based on its key (O(1)) which is much faster.

## When you would use a hash table

You can use it pretty much anywhere you would want to use a JavaScript object or a Python dictionary. Maybe your programming language doesn't have the concept of objects under the hood and you need to control where and how data is stored so you can access it quickly later.
